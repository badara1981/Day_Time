#SLEEP 

#time.sleep()
#Suspend execution for the given number of seconds. The actual suspension time may be less than that requested because any caught signal will terminate the time.sleep() following execution of that signalâ€™s catching routine. Also, the suspension time may be longer than requested by an arbitrary amount because of the scheduling of other activity in the system.
